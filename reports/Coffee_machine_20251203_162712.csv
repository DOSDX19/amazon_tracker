3-IN-1 Espresso Machine - Whether you prefer a rich espresso, cappuccino, or latte, you can automatically make coffee with just one click. Additionally, you can choose a single or double shot of coffee based on your preferred coffee rate and strength, better catering to your personalized needs and helping you become a barista with the espresso machine.
Espresso Machine with Milk Frother - Completely free your hands by using the automatic espresso machine with an automatic milk frother, which can create rich and delicate foam for lattes or cappuccinos, offering more convenience and speed than traditional manual steam wands. Its detachable design also makes cleaning effortless.
High Pressure Extraction - We build our espresso maker to be powered by a 20-bar professional Italian pump and a 1350W powerful motor, featuring pre-infusion technology for full coffee saturation. Compared to a 15-bar espresso machine, it extracts richer coffee oils, resulting in a more aromatic and flavorful cup of coffee.
Dual Boiler Heating - The 1350W coffee extraction boiler and 1000W milk frothing boiler work together to quickly extract espresso, cappuccino, or latte in just 15 seconds, ensuring optimal temperature and flavor. The dual boiler system evenly distributes the load, reducing wear compared to single-boiler expresso coffee machines.
Full Touchscreen Control - Just a touch of the LED panel on the espresso coffee maker allows you to easily enjoy rich coffee. The full touchscreen design streamlines the coffee-making process, saving time and making the preparation of delicious espresso easier than ever.
Stainless Steel Espresso Machine - The sleek and smooth stainless steel exterior on all four sides is not only durable and sturdy but also exudes a stylish aesthetic, perfectly complementing various kitchen styles.
Easy to Use - The dimensions of the small espresso machine are 7.9” (L) x 10.2” (W) x 12” (H), compact and space-saving, easily accommodating cups up to 4.1 inches in height to meet larger portion needs.
